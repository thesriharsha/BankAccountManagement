# BankAccountManagement

After completing the Main Project after Java Backend Training at Imaginnovate,
we were given induvidual projects so that we can be productive until we go to the Main office at Rushikonda.

So this Project is a simple Bank Account Management System, 
in which the main operations include 
-
1) Opening an Account with a necessary minimum balance.
2) Depositing money in a particular Account.
3) Withdrawing money in an account and throwing exception when the user try to withdraw more amount than available.
4) We can also view all the account details.
5) We can get a specific account balance.

This is a Java Backend Project and we didn't write any code for Frontend. 
We used Swagger UI and Postman as the Frontend to send neccessary Http Requests to our Backend Application.
For the Database we chose Ms SQL Server and created a DB and necessary tables in it.
And we created a Rest Controller in the SpringBootApplication. which contains our REST APIs.
